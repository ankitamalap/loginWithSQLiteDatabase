This is a small project with simply login and register page using SQLite Database.
SQLite is an open-source relational database i.e. used to perform database operations on android devices such as storing, manipulating or retrieving persistent data from the database. It is embedded in android bydefault. So, there is no need to perform any database setup or administration task.
